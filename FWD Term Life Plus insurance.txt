About your policy

Choosing who receives the benefits

Coverage renewal option

Death benefit

The coverage renewal option is available on the renewable
plan, where the period of insurance stated in the policy
schedule is “one year”. If this policy (including any add-on
rider plans) is valid at the end of the period of insurance, we
will automatically renew this policy by one more year.

This benefit will be paid to your nominee in a lump sum
equivalent to 100% of the sum insured for the death benefit,
as stated in the policy schedule.
If you die, one of the following people can request for us to
pay them an advance payment of S$5,000 from the death
benefit to cover your funeral expenses:
■

■

The nominee under the base plan with written consent of
any other nominees.
If there is no nominee, the legal spouse or an immediate
family member along with satisfactory proof of
relationship.

We will only make the advance payment of S$5,000 when we
receive the death certificate. The remainder of the sum
insured under the death benefit will be paid after we have
assessed the death claim application.

You can choose not to renew by writing to us 30 days before
the end of the period of insurance. See page 8 (coverage
renewal option) for more details.

Nomination
You can choose one or more nominees to receive the death
benefit. See page 9 (the main people under your policy) for
more details on your different choices.

Exclusions and conditions
This policy has certain exclusions, meaning situations where
we won’t pay a benefit. The specific and general exclusions
and/or conditions are set out throughout this policy contract.

Terminal illness benefit
This benefit will be paid to you in a lump sum equivalent to
100% of the sum insured for the death benefit, as stated in the
policy schedule.

this policy, your legal spouse can ask us to issue him/her a

policy, or S$250,000 (whichever of the two is lower)
payable if he/she dies or suffers from terminal illness; and
with a policy term of 1 year.

The legal spouse must be aged 55 years old or under at the
time of his/her complimentary policy issuance. The
complimentary insurance policy issued to your legal spouse
cannot be renewed or extended beyond the first 1 year.
We will deduct any monies you owe us on your policy before
we pay any claim.

When insurance cover begins
This policy starts on the coverage start date as shown in the
policy schedule or on the date we receive the first premium,
whichever is later.

Surrender values
If you surrender (cancel) your policy, you:
■

will lose the coverage under this policy; and

■

will not receive any amount in return.

In addition, any changes to your health or circumstances in
the future may make it more difficult or costly for you to get
coverage in the future.

14-day free-look period
If you aren’t completely satisfied with your policy, and you
haven’t made a claim under it, you have 14 calendar days from
the date you receive your policy to cancel it and receive your
premiums back, less any fees we have paid and/or expenses
incurred (if any). We consider this policy delivered from the
time we email it to you.
What you need to do

receive your notice within the 14-day free-look period.

What we will do
After receiving your notice, we will refund you any
premiums paid after deducting any fees we have paid
and/or expenses incurred (if any). Thereafter, we will
cancel your policy, and you will not be able to claim any
benefits under it.

we need to make a change, we will write to you 30 days in
advance.

We rely on your information
Read all parts of your policy to make sure they are
correct
This policy is issued based on the information you gave us
during the application process. It is important that the
information is correct, and you were truthful and accurate
with all of the information you provided. This information
helped us to decide if you were eligible for the policy, and
how much you need to pay.
The law as per Section 25(5) of the Insurance Act requires that
we inform you of your duty to fully and faithfully tell us
everything you know or could reasonably be expected to
know that is relevant to our decision to insure you. Otherwise,
we have the right to either decline your claims or terminate
this policy and treat it as never having existed. In the event
that we decide to maintain your cover, we may charge an
additional premium.

You need to provide correct and complete information
You and the person insured are responsible for:
■
■

Letting us have the correct and complete information.
Being careful when answering our questions, or when you
or the person insured confirm or amend any information
you have given to us.

If you don’t, we may not pay your claim, and your benefits
under your policy may be affected. In some cases, we may
cancel the policy. See page 14 (disputing payments) for more
details.

If we were given the wrong age and gender
If we discover that we were given the wrong age or gender,
we may adjust the amount of the benefit or premiums to
reflect what the benefit or premiums should have been if we
were provided with the correct age or gender in the first
place.
If we would not have issued this policy if we had known the
correct age, gender or any other details, we can declare your
policy void. If we do, we will cancel your policy and treat it as
never having existed. We will refund any premiums paid
without interest, after deducting any benefits we have paid.

If you need to change your information, or if you
have any questions, please call our hotline
at +65 6820 8888 (9am to 10pm – Monday to
Friday, 9am to 1pm – Saturday (excluding public
holidays)).

You should let us know immediately if the information you
gave us during the application, was inaccurate, misleading, or
exaggerated. You should also let us know immediately if the
information you have given us changes after your policy is
active.

Change in residential address:
You must inform us within 60 days if you change
your residential address.

Keeping it legal

Disputing payments
We can declare your policy void if you or the person insured:
■

■

made an inaccurate or untrue statement on a material
matter; or
suppressed or omitted a material fact, within your
application.

How we define material matters and facts
A material matter or material fact is one that would have
caused us to:
■
■

refuse to issue the policy to you; or
offer you a policy on different terms, if you or the person
insured had told us about it.

Unless there is fraud, we will not declare your policy void 2
years after the policy issue date or the reinstatement date
(the date you restart your policy), whichever is later.

■
■

at the order of the relevant authorities; or
if we discover, or if we have reasonable suspicion that you
are sanctioned under any competent authorities
recognised by us, for money laundering activities or
activities relating to financing terrorism.

If this happens, we will end your policy and the cover under it
immediately. We will deal with all premiums paid and all
amounts payable under your policy in any manner we deem
fit, which may include handing it over to the relevant
authorities.

FWD Term Life Plus - Total and Permanent Disability add-on rider policy contract v1.0

FWD Total and Permanent
Disability add-on rider
Thank you for choosing FWD Singapore Pte. Ltd. We’re pleased to protect you so that you
can focus on living life to the fullest. This rider provides additional protection if the person
insured suffers total and permanent disability (“TPD”).

Part of your policy

Who’s covered under your rider

This rider becomes part of your FWD Term Life Plus policy
(“base plan”) if we have agreed to provide it to you. The details
of your total and permanent disability cover will be shown in
this FWD TPD rider contract attached to your base plan.

Person insured

The terms and conditions of the base plan apply to this
add-on rider plan, unless stated otherwise.

We will pay the TPD benefit in a lump sum equivalent to 100%
of the sum insured for the TPD benefit, as stated in the policy
schedule, if you become totally and permanently disabled
due to an accident or sickness while this rider is in place.
The person insured under this rider has to be the same as the
person insured under your policy. The person insured cannot
receive any benefit under this rider, and cannot make changes
to your rider, unless the person insured is also the policy
owner.

Words with special meaning
The section below explains the meanings of words and phrases used in this document.
Totally and permanently
disabled or Total and
permanent disability

Means that, before your 65th birthday and due to accident or sickness, you:
■

Your rider benefits
Summary of your benefits
This section describes the main benefits of your rider. To
understand the full details about what we pay and how we
pay it, you should read the following section (detailed rider
benefits).
You can claim the following benefit while the
rider is in place.

The TPD benefit ends on the coverage end date, as stated in
your policy schedule, or on the policy anniversary of when
you reach age 65, whichever comes first.
We will pay you 100% of the TPD benefit sum
insured if the person insured suffers total and
permanent disability.

At any point in time, the TPD benefit payable will not be more
than the death benefit sum insured or the reduced death
benefit sum insured (if applicable).
If you have made a claim for other benefits which reduces the
death benefit sum insured to be less than the TPD benefit sum
insured, we will cap the amount payable for the TPD benefit
at the reduced death benefit sum insured.
Once we pay the reduced TPD benefit, death benefit or
terminal illness benefit, the rider and the base plan will
terminate automatically.
What we pay
Total and permanent disability benefit
If during the time this rider is valid:
■

Detailed rider benefits
This is an accelerating rider and it provides the following
protection benefits. You need to pay a separate premium to
keep this protection in place.

How an accelerating rider works
Your base plan provides the amount of cover (“sum insured”)
for death and terminal illness, as stated in your policy
schedule. Any claim made under the base plan or the rider will
be paid from such sum insured. We will pay the benefits until
the base plan sum insured is reached.

Your coverage under accelerating rider
If the TPD benefit sum insured equals to the death benefit
sum insured under the base plan, both the rider and the base
plan will terminate automatically after we pay the TPD
benefit.
If the TPD benefit sum insured is less than the death benefit
sum insured under the base plan, the death benefit sum
insured will be reduced and the rider will terminate
automatically after we pay the TPD benefit. In such instance,
the base plan will continue, and your subsequent premiums
will be reduced proportionately to your new sum insured.

2

■

You first experience symptoms that may lead to you
becoming totally and permanently disabled; and
a medical practitioner subsequently confirms that you
become totally and permanently disabled,

We will pay you the TPD benefit in a lump sum equivalent to
100% of the sum insured for TPD benefit, as stated in the
policy schedule. The cover for TPD will end when it is paid.
We will pay the TPD benefit amount shown in your policy
schedule, after taking off any amounts you owe us.

Important Notes
Please note that part of how we define total and
permanent disability is that you must be
completely unable to carry out any occupation.
This benefit is not payable if you are unable to
perform the same job duties you had before
your disability, or are unable to perform
a job that fits your training, education, or
experience, but you are able to engage in
other occupations, businesses or activities
for income, remuneration or profit.

FWD Term Life Plus - Total and Permanent Disability add-on rider policy contract v1.0

Your premiums
Your premiums are the amount you pay for protection. It is important to pay your premiums
on time so your rider stays active and the person insured continues to be covered. Below we
outline how you can pay your premiums and what happens if you don’t pay.

Amount

Refund of premiums after we approve a claim

Your current policy schedule shows the amount you need to
pay for this add-on rider.

If we accept a claim for the TPD benefit, we will refund
prorated premiums paid to us after the confirmed diagnosis.

When you need to pay premiums for your
rider

Any refunded premium amount will be paid on top of the
other amounts due to be paid under your rider.

You need to pay your premiums for this rider at the same time
as you pay your premiums for your base plan (annually,
semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly).

Premiums must be paid until we approve the claim
All premiums due under the base plan and any riders must be
paid until we approve the claim for the TPD benefit.

You can change your chosen method any time – if you do,
then your premiums for both base plan and rider will be
changed. Please refer to ‘changing your premium payment
method or frequency’ in your base plan contract for how to do
so.

Premium rates are guaranteed during the
period of insurance
The premium rates for TPD benefit, as stated in your policy
schedule, are guaranteed during the period of insurance. This
means we will not change the premium rates during the
period of insurance.

Premium rates upon renewal of the base plan
are not guaranteed
If you have chosen the coverage renewal option under the
base plan then the premium rates stated in your policy
schedule for future renewals are not guaranteed. This means
we may change the premium rates by giving you at least 30
days’ notice in writing.

What happens if you don’t pay on time?
Your rider premiums are due on the due date. We give you a
62-day grace period after the due date to pay. Your rider
coverage will continue if you pay your overdue premium
within this 62-day period. If we do not receive your premium
within this period, we will cancel your rider coverage.
If your rider coverage ends because you missed a premium
payment, you can apply to reinstate (restart) it. See page 5
(reinstating your rider) for more details.

What we don’t cover
What we don’t cover
This rider has certain exclusions, meaning situations where we won’t pay a benefit. We list below the exclusions that apply to the
benefits under your rider.
We may also apply specific exclusions to your rider when we offer to issue your rider.
If any specific exclusions apply, we will record the details in a rider endorsement.
Suicide or self-inflicted act

We will not pay any benefit under this rider if the claim arises from suicide, attempted
suicide or an intentional self-inflicted act. This applies regardless of the mental state of
the person insured. If this happens, the rider will be cancelled.

Unlawful acts

We will not pay any benefit under this rider if the claim arises because you or the person
insured deliberately participated in an unlawful act, or failed to act in accordance with
the law.

We won’t pay any benefit if the signs or symptoms leading to diagnosis an illness that lead to total and permanent disability and
claim, became apparent:
■

before the rider issue date; or

■

before the rider reinstatement date (if the rider cover was restarted).

The above applies even if the signs or symptoms were not apparent to you, if they would have been apparent to a reasonable
person in the same position.

When cover starts under your rider

Reinstating your rider

We start the rider cover on the coverage start date, unless

Your rider benefits
Summary of your benefits
This section describes the main benefits of your rider. To
understand the full details about what we pay and how we
pay it, you should read the following section (detailed rider
benefits).

You can claim the following benefit while the rider
is in place.
The critical illness benefit ends on the coverage end date, as
stated in your policy schedule.
We will pay the critical illness benefit in
a lump sum equivalent to 100% of the
sum insured for critical illness benefit,
as stated in the policy schedule, if the
person insured suffers a covered critical
illness condition (other than ‘Angioplasty
and other invasive treatment for coronary
artery’) while this rider is in place.

Detailed rider benefits
This is an accelerating rider and it provides the following
protection benefits. You need to pay a separate premium to
keep this protection in place.
How an accelerating rider works
Your base plan provides the amount of cover (“sum insured”)
for death and terminal illness, as stated in your policy
schedule. Any claim made by the person insured under the
base plan or the rider will be paid from such sum insured. We
will pay the benefits until the base plan sum insured is
reached.
Your coverage under accelerating rider
If the critical illness benefit sum insured equals to the death
benefit sum insured under the base plan, both the rider and
the base plan will terminate automatically after we pay the
critical illness benefit.
If the critical illness benefit sum insured is less than the death
benefit sum insured under the base plan, the death benefit
sum insured will be reduced and the rider will terminate
automatically after we pay the critical illness benefit. In such
instance, the base plan will continue, and your subsequent
premiums will be reduced proportionately to your new sum
insured.

2

At any point in time, the critical illness benefit payable will not
be more than the death benefit sum insured or the reduced
death benefit sum insured (if applicable).
If you have made a claim for other benefits which reduces the
death benefit sum insured to be less than the critical illness
benefit sum insured, we will cap the amount payable for the
critical illness benefit at the reduced death benefit sum
insured.
Once we pay the reduced critical illness benefit, death
benefit or terminal illness benefit, the rider and base plan will
terminate automatically.
What we pay
Diagnosis of ‘Angioplasty with other invasive treatment for
coronary artery’
If during the time this rider is valid:
■

■

You first experience symptoms that result in you needing
‘Angioplasty and other invasive treatment for coronary
artery’; and
a medical practitioner subsequently confirms that you
need this treatment,

We will pay 10% of the sum insured under the base plan,
subject to a maximum amount of S$25,000.
Both the base plan and this rider will remain valid after this
benefit payment. However, the base plan sum insured (death
benefit sum insured and terminal illness benefit sum insured)
will be reduced accordingly:

Revised sum insured = original sum insured
– benefit we have paid you is in place.
For example, if the original sum insured is
S$100,000 and the benefit claimed is S$25,000,
your revised sum insured will be S$75,000
(S$100,000 – S$25,000).

We will also reduce all future premiums in proportion to this
revised sum insured.
We will only pay the benefit for “Angioplasty and other
invasive treatment for coronary artery” once under this rider.

outline how you can pay your premiums and what happens if you don’t pay.

Amount

Refund of premiums after we approve a claim

Your current policy schedule shows the amount you need to
pay for this add-on rider.

If we accept a claim for the critical illness benefit, we will
refund prorated premiums paid to us after the confirmed
diagnosis.

When you need to pay premiums for your
rider
You need to pay your premiums for this rider at the same time
as you pay your premiums for your base plan (annually,
semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly).
You can change your chosen method any time – if you do,
then your premiums for both base plan and rider will be
changed. Please refer to ‘changing your premium payment
method or frequency’ in your base plan contract for how to do
so.

Any refunded premium amount will be paid on top of the
other amounts due to be paid under your rider.

Premiums must be paid until we approve the claim
All premiums due under the base plan and any riders must be
paid until we approve the claim for critical illness benefit.

Premium rates are not guaranteed
The premiums that you pay for the critical illness benefit are
not guaranteed during the period of insurance and is subject
to change during the period of insurance. We will let you
know 30 days in advance if your critical illness benefit
premiums are being revised.

What happens if you don’t pay on time?
Your rider premiums are due on the due date. We give you a
62-day grace period after the due date to pay. Your rider
coverage will continue if you pay your overdue premium
within this 62-day period. If we do not receive your premium
within this period, we will cancel your rider coverage.
If your rider coverage ends because you missed a premium
payment, you can apply to reinstate (restart) it. See page 6
(reinstating your rider) for more details.

Unlawful acts

We will not pay any benefit under this rider if the claim arises because you or the person
insured deliberately participated in an unlawful act, or failed to act in accordance with the
law.

■

before the rider issue date; or

■

before the rider reinstatement date (if the rider cover was restarted).

Your rider premiums are due on the due date. We give you a
62-day grace period after the due date to pay. Your rider
coverage will continue if you pay your overdue premium
within this 62-day period. If we do not receive your premium
within this period, we will cancel your rider coverage.
If your rider coverage ends because you missed a premium
payment, you can apply to reinstate (restart) it. See page 5
(reinstating your rider) for more details.

What we don’t cover
What we don’t cover
This rider has certain exclusions, meaning situations where we won’t pay a benefit. We list below the exclusions that apply to the
benefits under your rider.
We may also apply specific exclusions to your rider when we offer to issue your rider. If any specific exclusions apply, we will
record the details in a rider endorsement.
Suicide or self-inflicted act

Premium waiver benefit will not be available for total and permanent disability or
critical illness that directly or indirectly results from attempted suicide or an
intentional self-inflicted act by yourself.
This applies regardless of the mental state of the person insured. If this happens, the
rider will be cancelled.

Unlawful acts

Premium waiver benefit will not be available under this rider if the claim arises
because you or the person insured deliberately participated in an unlawful act, or
failed to act in accordance with the law.

Angioplasty and other invasive
treatment for coronary artery

Premium waiver benefit will not be available for a critical illness that directly or
indirectly results from ‘Angioplasty and other invasive treatment for coronary artery’.

We won’t pay any benefit if the signs or symptoms leading to the diagnosis of a critical illness or total and permanent disability,
and claim, became apparent:
■

before the rider issue date; or

■

before the rider reinstatement date (if the rider cover was restarted).

The above applies even if the signs or symptoms were not apparent to you, if they would have been apparent to a reasonable
person in the same position.
